# Numpy usage

Some basic operaters for using numpy. Collected during the writing homework.

## numpy.where

```numpy.where(condition, if condition == True, if condition == False)```

return the index only writing the condition inside:  ```numpy.where(condition)```

This is a great function when you want to split x based on y. Detailed see CS571 HW1.
